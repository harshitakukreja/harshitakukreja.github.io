abstract={A biometric system uses pattern recognition to identify an individual based on various traits such as the face, fingerprints, etc. Adverse or uncontrolled conditions can often lead to the introduction of noise in data. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of noise on the quality of images that are input into a biometric system. Further, we analyze the role of various filters in the denoising of images. The paper proposes a robust deep learning-based framework in Pytorch to classify denoised images, which is validated by evaluating performance metrics on two popular benchmarks. Our study shows that our proposed framework helps achieve state-of-the-art accuracy without any trade-off caused due to the introduction of noise in images.},

abstract={With the growing use of biometric authentication in real-world applications, there are growing concerns related to the privacy of biometric templates enrolled in the database. Many algorithms have been proposed for the protection of biometric templates, however, this leads to a trade-off between the security of templates and matching performance. In this work, we propose a robust framework for improving upon the existing biometric template protection techniques. The proposed method uses one-shot enrollment for the mapping of images against unique binary codes assigned to them. The binary codes are obtained by binarization of image pixels. This is followed by the use of the SHA-256 hash function, and the class labels are generated based on the hashes templates. This is followed by the extraction of features using a deep convolutional architecture. During verification, the predicted labels are matched against labels generated from the hashed templates of the users stored during enrollment. The proposed framework is capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract={A multimodal biometric system utilizes more than one biometric modality of a person to relieve some of the shortcomings of a unimodal biometric system and improves its security. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for fusing the features extracted from the individual's face and iris (left and right) to get a more secure biometric verification system. Firstly, we extract the facial and iris features separately using various convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Further, the feature vectors of the final CNN layers of both models are fused to achieve classification of individuals with improved performance. The proposed system is tested on the CASIA-Face V5 dataset for faces and IITD iris dataset for left and right irises. The results achieved prove the superiority of the proposed multimodal system. It is efficient, reliable, and robust as compared to unimodal biometric systems.},
